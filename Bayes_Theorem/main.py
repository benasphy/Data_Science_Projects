        ### About Bayes' Theorem
        
        Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental principle in probability theory that describes the probability of an event 
        based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. The theorem is stated mathematically as:
        
        P(A|B) = P(B|A) √ó P(A) / P(B)
        
        Where:
        - P(A|B) is the posterior probability
        - P(B|A) is the likelihood
        - P(A) is the prior probability
        - P(B) is the normalizing constant
        
        These projects demonstrate various applications of this powerful theorem in both recreational mathematics 
        and real-world scenarios.
