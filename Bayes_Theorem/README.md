# Bayes' Theorem Interactive Projects

This repository contains three interactive Streamlit applications demonstrating Bayes' Theorem through recreational mathematics and practical applications:

1. **Monty Hall Problem**: Interactive simulation of the famous probability puzzle
2. **Two Child Problem**: Exploration of conditional probability in a classic puzzle
3. **Drug Testing**: Practical application of Bayes' Theorem in medical testing

## Setup
1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run any project (from the project directory):
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Each project demonstrates Bayes' Theorem in a unique and interactive way.
