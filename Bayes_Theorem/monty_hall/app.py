    ### Understanding Bayes' Theorem through a Classic Puzzle

    The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after the host of the TV show 'Let's Make a Deal'.
    Here's the scenario:
    - There are three doors, behind one is a car, behind the others are goats
    - You pick a door
    - The host (who knows what's behind each door) opens another door showing a goat
    - You can either stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining door

    What should you do? Let's simulate to find out!

    ### Why does switching give you a better chance?

    Using Bayes' Theorem, we can explain this counterintuitive result:

    P(Win|Switch) = P(Car in Other Door|Initial Choice Wrong) Ã— P(Initial Choice Wrong)

    - P(Initial Choice Wrong) = 2/3
    - P(Car in Other Door|Initial Choice Wrong) = 1

    Therefore, P(Win|Switch) = 2/3 â‰ˆ 67%

    While P(Win|Stay) = P(Initial Choice Right) = 1/3 â‰ˆ 33%
