    ### A Probability Puzzle Using Bayes' Theorem

    The Two Child Problem is a probability puzzle that demonstrates how additional information affects probability calculations.

    **The Problem:**
    - A family has two children
    - We know at least one of them is a girl
    - What's the probability that both children are girls?

    Many people intuitively answer 1/2, but let's see why this is incorrect using simulation and Bayes' Theorem!

    ### Simulation Results
    In our simulation with {n_simulations:,} families:
    - The probability of both children being girls, given that at least one is a girl: **{probability:.1%}**

    ### Explanation using Bayes' Theorem

    P(Both Girls | At least one Girl) = P(Both Girls) / P(At least one Girl)

    - P(Both Girls) = 1/4
    - P(At least one Girl) = 3/4

    Therefore: P(Both Girls | At least one Girl) = (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3 ‚âà 33%

    This demonstrates how conditional probability can lead to counterintuitive results!
