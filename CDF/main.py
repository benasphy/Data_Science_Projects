    ### Understanding Cumulative Distribution Functions
    
    The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics that 
    describes the probability that a random variable X takes on a value less than or equal to x.
    
    Mathematically, for a random variable X, the CDF is defined as:
    
    F(x) = P(X ‚â§ x)
    
    CDFs have several important properties:
    - They are non-decreasing (monotonically increasing)
    - They range from 0 to 1
    - For continuous distributions, F(x) = ‚à´<sub>-‚àû</sub><sup>x</sup> f(t) dt, where f(t) is the PDF
    - For discrete distributions, F(x) = ‚àë<sub>t‚â§x</sub> P(X = t)

        ### Why are CDFs Important?
        
        Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) are powerful tools in probability and statistics for several reasons:
        
        1. **Calculating Probabilities**: CDFs directly give the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a specific value
        
        2. **Finding Percentiles**: The inverse of the CDF gives percentiles of the distribution
        
        3. **Comparing Distributions**: CDFs provide a visual way to compare different distributions
        
        4. **Generating Random Variables**: CDFs are used in the inverse transform sampling method to generate random variables
        
        5. **Statistical Tests**: Many statistical tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, use CDFs
        
        6. **Risk Assessment**: In finance, CDFs help calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and other risk measures
        
        ### Relationship Between PDF and CDF
        
        For continuous distributions:
        - The CDF is the integral of the PDF: F(x) = ‚à´<sub>-‚àû</sub><sup>x</sup> f(t) dt
        - The PDF is the derivative of the CDF: f(x) = d/dx F(x)
        
        For discrete distributions:
        - The CDF is the sum of the PMF: F(x) = ‚àë<sub>t‚â§x</sub> P(X = t)
        - The PMF can be derived from the CDF as P(X = x) = F(x) - F(x-)
        
        ### Applications in Data Science
        
        - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying values in the tails of a distribution
        - **Quantile Regression**: Modeling the relationship between variables at different quantiles
        - **Survival Analysis**: Modeling time-to-event data
        - **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Generating random samples for simulation studies
