# Data Science Interactive Projects

This repository contains a suite of interactive Streamlit applications for exploring core concepts in probability, statistics, and data science. The apps are organized by statistical themes and cover a wide range of topics, from basic distributions to advanced estimation and inference techniques.

## Project Structure

- **PMF/**: Discrete distributions, probability mass functions, and related simulations.
- **PDF/**: Probability density functions, kernel density estimation, and continuous distributions.
- **CDF/**: Cumulative distribution functions, survival analysis, and distribution comparison tools.
- **Estimation/**: Point estimation, maximum likelihood, method of moments, Bayesian estimation, and confidence intervals.
- **Summary_Statistics/**: Explorers for central tendency, dispersion, and correlation analysis.
- **Statistical_Laws/**: Central Limit Theorem and law of large numbers interactive visualizations.

## Features
- Interactive dashboards for each statistical topic
- Visualizations using Plotly
- Real-time parameter adjustment with Streamlit widgets
- Support for both theoretical and simulated data
- Modular and extensible codebase
